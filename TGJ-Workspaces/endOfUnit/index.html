				<h1>General History</h1>
				<p>The automotive industry in Japan is one of the most prominent and largest industries in the world. Japan has been in
					the top three of the countries with most cars manufactured since the 1960s, surpassing Germany. The automotive industry
					in Japan rapidly increased from the 1970s to the 1990s (when it was oriented both for domestic use and worldwide export)
					and in the 1980s and 1990s, overtook the U.S. as the production leader with up to 13 million cars per year manufactured
					and significant exports. After massive ramp-up by China in the 2000s and fluctuating U.S. output, Japan is now currently
					the third largest automotive producer in the world with an annual production of 9.9 million automobiles in 2012.[1]
					Japanese investments helped grow the auto industry in many countries throughout the last few decades.</p>
