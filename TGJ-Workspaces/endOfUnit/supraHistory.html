                    Supra History
                </h1>

                <p>The Toyota Supra is a sports car/grand tourer that was produced by Toyota Motor Corporation from 1978 to
                    2002. The styling of the Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[2]
                    Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped
                    using the prefix Celica and began just calling the car Supra.[3] Owing to the similarity and past of
                    the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. First, second, and third
                    generation Supras were assembled at Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi while the fourth generation Supra was
                    assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The Supra also traces much of its roots back to the
                    Toyota 2000GT with the main instance being its engine. The first three generations were offered with
                    a direct descendant to the Toyota Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. All four generations of Supra produced
                    have an inline 6-cylinder engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along
                    with this name and car Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It is derived from the original
                    Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra
                    was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without
                    the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval
                    company logo. (The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what color it was. It appeared on the
                    first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used
                    for the Celica line until it too was discontinued.)
